Embarking on the journey of investment isn't just a hobby for me, it's a meticulous strategy carved out of the necessity to preserve wealth. I like to believe my outlook is cautiously optimistic, prepare for the worst and hope for the best. I see a lot of opportunities for value creation via new technologies like computing, biosciences, sustainable energy, and space.  Technology change has changed the environment so fast that human cultures and institutions have not yet fully adapted. The whiplash from these changes have the potential to erupt into global conflicts. I forsee a continued period of conflict and declining trust in institutions.

Today, I'm peeling back the curtain on my investment strategy. My investment thesis hinges on a simple yet profound belief: **own what others will desire.** This belief is the cornerstone of my portfolio, a balance between present liquidity and liquidity expectations across varying timeframes. These time frames are aligned with my liquidity needs, such as funds for emergencies, investment opportunities, and retirement. I will discuss my investments in order of these time frames, which also reflects the order in which I would prefer to liquidate assets if necessary.

## Cash and Cash Equivalents:

**US Dollars and Money Markets:** In the realm of liquidity, the US Dollar reigns supreme. Globally dollars can be considered liquidity itself. So I hold a lot of my money in dollar money market funds. If I need cash fast, this is where I can look to first. Money market funds have nearly never broken the buck in the history of American finance. However, considering concerns around national debt and currency devaluation, I hedge with inflation-pegged money market funds. I do have skepticism about the long term sustainability of the US's debt. But I also believe the inflation we saw coming out of the pandemic was not due to monetary policy, but a supply shock. I believe it will take a lot deeper amounts of spending for the dollar to start debasing. Japan's adventure in central bank intervention has demonstrated that high debt levels can be sustained, at least so far. I'm willing to align with the MMT proponents that the government's spending capacity is much larger than we currently believe.

**Why I Might Be Wrong**: The towering debt across all sectors in the US poses a perpetual threat of currency debasement. On top of that, the sheer necessity of significant fiscal spending, driven by climate change and onshoring, keeps me wary of the dollar's long term prospects.

**Foreign Currencies and Money Markets:** Diversification is key, hence my investments in foreign money markets and currencies from regions I consider as havens, including emerging markets for growth potential and countries like Switzerland, Singapore, and New Zealand for their political and economic stability. I chose these countries because they have a strong history of rule of law, property rights, and openness to Americans.

**Why I Might Be Wrong:** My strategy leans heavily on western affiliated markets, a risky bet if BRICS nations rise to economic prominence or a scenario of mass dollarization undermines non-dollar currencies.

## Stablecoins and DeFi:

My approach to stablecoins and defi in my portfolio is to view them as a hedge against disruptions in the traditional financial market. I do believe in the viability of decentralized ledger technology. In the broader context of stablecoins, my perspective is categorized into three main types: centralized, algorithmic, and collateralized stablecoins. Each carries its own set of advantages and vulnerabilities that I consider carefully:

**Centralized Stablecoins:** These are issued by centralized entities and pegged to a fiat currency, like the US dollar, on a 1:1 basis. While they offer of stability and are widely used in DeFi for transactions and savings, my trust in them is fairly limited to USDC. I harbor a strong belief that Tether (USDT) is not to be trusted, and I have significant concerns over its [reliability and transparency](https://protos.com/tag/tether/). I avoid it at all costs. Because USDC is [backed by a money market fund](https://www.circle.com/en/transparency) ran by [Blackrock](https://www.blackrock.com/cash/en-us/products/329365/circle-reserve-fund). I value USDC as a claim on a money market fund that is valid as long as Circle is solvent. 

**Algorithmic Stablecoins:** These are designed to maintain their peg through algorithmic mechanisms, adjusting supply based on demand. Avoiding these has been pretty easy for me, because they don't work. See Terra Luna...

**Collateralized Stablecoins:** These are backed by other cryptocurrencies rather than fiat currencies, which I view as having interesting tradeoffs with their centralized counterparts. I try to ensure I don't have too much exposure to these. I try to avoid holding these in excess of the value of debt I'm holding, denominated in the same token. I currently don't trust any of the protocols sufficiently to hold the asset as a liability. 

**Why I Might Be Wrong:** The stablecoin ecosystem's resilience is tested by the viability of centralized stablecoins and exchange liquidity. This dependency is a critical aspect of how users can convert these stablecoins into physical cash. If liquidity in the markets for centralized stablecoins or on crypto exchanges themselves dries up, individual users, particularly those who are not businesses with direct access to banking or financial institutions, face a significant barrier in turning their collateralized stablecoins into usable fiat currency. So centralized exchanges and stablecoins are centralized points of failure for all stablecoins.

## Cryptocurrencies and Digital Assets:

As I mentioned earlier, I believe in a future for decentralized smart contract protocols. I've worked on software used by banks and that has given me some unique experience on the inside of them. They are horrendously inefficient and are largely bureaucratic extensions of the state. Corruption is also a massive issue in the developing world and incentive based protocols have an opportunity to address that because "don't trust, verify".

### Bitcoin

That being said, I'm very very wary of [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/en/). The cult of the Bitcoin maxis has not won me over. There are a number of reasons why I'm wary to have much exposure to it.

#### Self Custody

The intrinsic value of BTC tokens revolves around their role as liabilities to a network. BTC represents essentially a promise by the network to allow the holder to mutate the network's global ledger. This dependency on the network's operational integrity and collective belief system transforms Bitcoin into a unique form of liability, contrary to the widespread perception of it as a custodial asset. Bitcoin maxis love to claim that it is digital gold and like physical gold it has no counterparty risk. But this untrue. I can own and use gold even if every person on earth disappeared, this is not true for Bitcoin, as other participants are required for consensus. Even if I was somehow able to run a node on my own, I'd need the network to exist in some capacity so that I can actually acquire the current state of the ledger. 

#### Deflationary Economics

BTC's fundamental value being tied to the the value of a decentralized transaction makes it impossible to be deflationary beyond the protocol level. Sure BTC supply is deflationary, but that doesn't prevent monetary phenomena from playing out. Because more BTC could not be minted, people simply [created new blockchains (Litecoin, BCH, etc)](https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/05/17/the-blocksize-wars-revisited-how-bitcoins-civil-war-still-resonates-today/) in order to create more supply of blockspace. For Bitcoin's protocol level deflation to actually work out in practice, it has to be unique in such a way that no other chain actually fulfills the same function. It only works if its a monopoly and blockspace is not a commodity.

#### Maxis

This brings me to Maxis, who believe that Bitcoin is unique in a way that no other chain can fulfill. The arguments posited by Bitcoin maximalists often hinge on the concept of network effects as the linchpin for Bitcoin's supremacy. But even if you think that [PoW](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-work.asp) is the only valid consensus mechanism, that doesn't mean BTC wins all because there are plenty of other PoW (or similar like [Proof of Space](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Proof_of_space)) chains. The only viable way this makes sense is if there is some way that PoW is the only viable consensus, and there are non linear network effects to having more miners in PoW such that the market is winner take all. The Maxis deep down know their bet only pays off if Bitcoin is a monopoly. And unsurprisingly, they lobby to have other tokens labeled illegal by the government.

### Community

The community is a major reason I am against investing in BTC. I've been engaged in the online crypto community since 2012, when I was first introduced to Bitcoin. It was around the time of "the Blocksize Wars"](https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/05/17/the-blocksize-wars-revisited-how-bitcoins-civil-war-still-resonates-today/) that I started to sour on the community. It is also around this time that it feels the Maxis gained a strong voice in the Bitcoin community. I have tried to listen to big thought leaders in the Maxi camp and there are very few I think even remotely know what they are talking about. Figures like Michael Saylor are spotlighted for their evangelistic fervor, which, while driving attention, also crystallizes the echo chamber mentality that pervades this space. Such singular viewpoints, often lacking in critical engagement with legitimate critiques or innovations outside of Bitcoin, reflect a broader issue of intellectual stagnation and unwarranted hubris. The exception is [Lin Alden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHPXGsYVPx8), who I don't always agree with, but is approaches the topic with a genuine sense of intellectualism.

### Ethereum

Ethereum, in contrast to Bitcoin, presents a more versatile and dynamic framework, particularly with its smart contract capabilities. While not without its flaws, Ethereum's ability to attract and retain developer mindshare may indeed have a form of network effect, albeit different from what Bitcoin maximalists envision. This developer-centric ecosystem could potentially elevate Ethereum above its competitors, not through sheer superiority but through a critical mass of innovation and application development. If the EVM network effects don't materialize, I see Ethereum as long term being replaced by new generation L1 smart contract platforms. 

### Algorand

My admiration for Algorand is profound, stemming from its implementation of sortition via [pure proof of stake](https://people.csail.mit.edu/nickolai/papers/gilad-algorand-eprint.pdf). I believe the Algorand consensus represents a leap forward in the quest for scalable, secure, and decentralized networks. [Running an Algorand node personally](https://app.nf.domains/name/pescennius.algo), I've observed firsthand the elegance and efficiency of its protocol, affirming my belief in its potential to [solve the trilema](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NykZ-ZSKkxM). [Algorand Inc puts out some of the best tooling](https://developer.algorand.org/algokit/) in the industry, and the [Go code](https://github.com/algorand/go-algorand) they write is much better than the quality of code I've seen in a lot of ecosystems. Its great to see real world, non scam, use cases like [Hesabpay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GPONHm2kck), [Travelx](https://www.travelx.io/), [Agrotoken](https://www.agrotoken.com/en/home), etc compared to Solana or Avalanche which have too high a concentration of degen tokens. [Algorand's Governance system](https://governance.algorand.foundation/governance-period-11), while far from perfect, better represents the kinds of democratic ideals that I want to see in the future of finance.

### Arweave

[Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/) is an incredible idea. The idea of permanent storage and its so elegantly conceptualized. Arweave embodies my investment thesis, "own what others will desire". I believe I'm very early but human beings crave immortality and Arweave is an actual product offering people the ability to cement their [legacies](https://acvydk5fvmg3onipgalooiwk5fl2on3wlls3zxfbyhyfdbmx3zua.pensieve.ngrok.io/AKuBq6WrDbc1DzAW5yLK6VenN3Za5bzcocHwUYWX3mg). Arweave is the network I can conceptualize the most ways to build on top of and the only one I've contributed to personally. I don't know if will be greatest investment, but it might be the most impactful technology.

### Why I might be wrong

While I've outlined a critical perspective on Bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies, and the broader crypto ecosystem, it's crucial to entertain the notion that my analysis might miss the mark on several fronts. Firstly, Bitcoin's potential to establish a monopolistic dominance cannot be entirely dismissed. This could materialize through the network effects of Proof of Work (PoW) miners, a constituency that might solidify Bitcoin's position due to the immense computational investment and infrastructure already committed. Additionally, government regulation poses a double-edged sword; while it could stifle innovation and adoption across the crypto spectrum, it might also inadvertently favor Bitcoin, either through regulatory capture by entrenched interests or by creating a regulatory moat that only Bitcoin can effectively navigate due to its first-mover advantage and widespread recognition.

Beyond Bitcoin, the entire cryptocurrency paradigm faces existential threats that could undermine my bullish stance on certain technologies and platforms. Governmental crackdowns, driven by concerns over monetary sovereignty, financial stability, or a combination of both, could lead to severe restrictions or outright bans. Such actions could not only impede adoption but also erode the foundational premise of decentralization that underpins the crypto world.

Furthermore, the technological feasibility of cryptocurrencies, in general, remains an open question. Despite the advancements and innovations within the space, there are unresolved challenges related to scalability, security, and energy consumption, especially for networks relying on PoW consensus mechanisms. The possibility exists that these hurdles prove insurmountable, leading to a scenario where cryptocurrencies fail to achieve their transformative potential.

In essence, the road to cryptocurrency adoption and utility is fraught with uncertainty. The very aspects I've critiqued—Bitcoin's perceived liabilities, the deflationary myth, and the overemphasis on network effects—could, under certain conditions, pivot in a way that cements Bitcoin's dominance or even ensures the survival of cryptocurrencies at large.

## Equities

Diversification is a key tenet of my equity portfolio, but not in the indiscriminate manner often preached. It's a carefully calibrated diversification that aligns with broader economic trends and technological shifts, aiming to mitigate risk while capturing the upside of transformative developments. I primarily invest in ETFs, however there are a few positions where I've decided its worthit to concentrate in one equity:

- Sustainable Energy ETFs
- Commodities and Base Metal ETFs 
- Overweight Oil and Gold Mining ETFs
- Healthcare ETFs
- Defense ETFs
- Specific Emerging Market ETFs: Mexico, Turkey, and Vietnam
- REITs ($LAND, $CLDT, and $NYC)
- Rocket LAB ($RKTL)
- ARM ($ARM)
- Berkshire Hathaway ($BRK.B)

I avoid investments in China, I was [burned by Luckin Coffee](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/luckin-coffee-reaches-175-million-class-action-settlement-over-accounting-fraud-2021-10-26/) and since have sworn off Chinese equities. There is simply too much fraud in that market, even if there are legitimate opportunities.

## Fixed Income

In the landscape of fixed income investments, my strategy diverges significantly from the prevailing trend towards passive, equity-heavy portfolios. Many of my peers have embraced a strategy of allocating 100% of their retirement funds into stock indices like the S&P 500, driven by the allure of historic stock market returns. However, this approach overlooks the cyclical nature of markets and the diversification benefits that fixed income assets provide, especially in the context of shifting demographic trends.

The demographic shift with baby boomers entering retirement poses a critical inflection point for the financial markets. As this cohort begins to liquidate equities to fund their retirement lifestyles or shifts towards bonds to preserve accumulated wealth, the potential for net outflows from the stock market increases, which could introduce volatility and pressure on equity valuations. Concurrently, the liquidation of bonds by retirees to finance their living expenses suggests an upward trajectory for interest rates over the longer term, further compounded by substantial government borrowing needs. These needs stem from various initiatives, including onshoring efforts, sustainable energy investments, and the fiscal demands of geopolitical engagements such as the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East. Additionally, macroeconomic factors like shrinking oil and labor supplies are likely to exert upward pressure on prices, reinforcing the case for a cautious approach to inflation.

In this environment, where interest rates are already surpassing the 5% mark, I've strategically positioned myself to capitalize on the opportunities presented by the current rate regime. I've invested in [Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS)](https://www.usbank.com/investing/financial-perspectives/investing-insights/what-are-tips-bonds.html#:~:text=Treasury%20Inflation%2DProtected%20Securities%2C%20or,before%20investing%20in%20TIPS%20bonds.) on the secondary market, securing real rates of return around 2% for durations spanning 10 to 20 years.t. This maneuver not only hedges against the erosion of purchasing power due to any inflation but also locks in a guaranteed real return—a rare find in today's volatile market environment. Additionally, the procurement of FDIC-insured Certificates of Deposit (CDs) at these elevated rates complements my fixed income portfolio, offering a blend of security, attractive returns, and protection against inflationary pressures.

## Gold

Gold is often over-looked by my peers, who laugh at it as "boomer rocks".  It occupies a unique position within my investment portfolio, as I tend to hold it [largely physically](https://www.goldback.com/). My attraction to gold is rooted not in its physical allure but in its proven track record as a store of value across millennia as well as its lack of counterparty risk. In times of inflation, geopolitical turmoil, or financial market volatility, gold has consistently demonstrated its ability to preserve wealth, standing as a bulwark against the erosion of purchasing power that plagues fiat currencies.

However, my stance on gold is tempered by a critical understanding of its limitations. It's important to recognize that gold does not produce income or dividends, and its value is largely tied to the fact that it can be owned without liability. Therefore, while it forms an essential part of my diversification strategy, it does so within the confines of the knowledge that its ultimately an insurance plan I never want to need.

## Real Estate

Real estate investment, for me, is intricately linked to my partner's familial assets. Her inheritance will have properties in New York, Pennsylvania, and California, instilling a sense of contentment with my current level of direct property exposure. This inheritance not only represents a significant asset base but also diminishes the necessity for aggressive expansion within the real estate market.

In lieu of further direct property acquisitions, my strategy pivots towards Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), specifically those operating outside the residential sector. This approach not only diversifies my investment portfolio but also mitigates the direct responsibilities and maintenance concerns associated with property ownership. The plan will be to use the revenue from this fund to finance family vacations, that way we gain the same personal benefit as owning a beach home.


## Conclusion

If you take anything away from reading this, its that you should invest in what you feel confident will have value in the future. That should look different than my portfolio because our perspectives on the world are different. I hope by writing this out, anyone who reads it can help to see how they can begin to translate their opinions about the future into an investment strategy.
